# ADC_calibration
Read  in real time in order to calibrate the sensor array faster
It reads the log file generated by the software 'teraterm' during the calibration of the sensor array.

It reads the ADC values and plots them in real time for an array of 64 sensors.
Time is expressed in seconds. It takes the current time of the day, converts it in secondes and starts plotting from there.

- If the ADC value > the threshold, it means that the sensor is 'too hot'.
    A spot 'red' will be displayed at the location of the sensor.

- If the ADC value is in the acceptable range, it means that the sensor is 'ready for the calibration'.
    A spot 'green' will be displayed at the location of the sensor.

- If the ADC value < the not_connected_threshold, it means that the sensor is 'not connected'.
    A spot 'white' will be displayed at the location of the sensor.

- If the ADC value > the not_connected_threshold and < the minimal_threshold, it means that the sensor
is 'not fully connected' or is not completely ready for calibration.
    A spot 'cyan' will be displayed at the location of the sensor.
